# quillbot-plagiarizer

CLI tool that uses Chrome Headless underneath, prompting you what sentence to plagiarize (rephrase).

# This package is unmaintained
To those few people who starred this - There's a better way to fetch the information than using headless chrome. There's an API to fetch from directly, instead of scraping the page. But I feel like most people who starred this repo wanted to see examples of how to use `Puppeteer`. 

Anyway, I thought I should let you know.
